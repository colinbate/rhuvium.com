<h1>Random Sub Generator</h1>

<div class="notice"><h3>9 October 2005</h3>
I am no longer living or working in the same place I was when I created
this program, and as such I am not as current on Subway sandwiches. For example
I know that Subway (in Nova Scotia anyway) had changed the way that they price
their subs, but I do not have that information available here. In fact this
generator is like a snapshot in time back to April 2005.
</div>

<p>
Are you a frequent Subway patron? Are you just tired
of your usual fare and can't decide what to get? Want to
try something new but don't know what would be good?
</p>
<p>
Yes? Perfect. You are in the right spot as this is the
Subway Random Sub Generator.
</p>

<div class="notice"><h3>Note</h3>
The toppings and prices are those available at the Subway in which I eat lunch
every day. That is the prices are Canadian as are the selection of toppings,
more specifically the toppings available at the Subway restaurant in the IWK
hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
