<h1>Group Hug <span class="beta">Beta</span></h1>

<p>Group Hug is an easy to use Python-based RSS/Atom feed aggregator. If you have multiple weblogs and you would like to combine them all into one location &mdash; either for public display or simply for personal convenience, than this is the right tool for you. Perhaps you would like to aggregate all of the weblogs of your friends or colleagues into one location for a centralized information source. Whatever your reasons, combining multiple feeds into one site has never been this easy before.</p>
	
<p>Built on top of Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://www.feedparser.org">feedparser.py</a> it handles all the various versions of RSS and Atom that are in use at the moment. It also uses <a href="http://linux.duke.edu/projects/urlgrabber/">urlgrabber</a> to make sure that we don't download the whole feed if it hasn't been modified.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the software isn't available for download at the moment. It is still undergoing proper testing before being released for public consumption. If you found this page from a User Agent string, then likely someone is aggregating your feed using Group Hug.</p>
